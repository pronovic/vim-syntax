# Vim Syntax

These are Vim syntax files that I maintain.  They were originally hosted at software.cedar-solutions.com.

The [MySQL syntax file](mysql.vim) is part of the official Vim distribution, although it hasn't changed in years.  The rest are for my own personal use.

See also: the [old-utils](https://github.com/pronovic/old-utils) repository, which includes various utilities originally published alongside these syntax files.
